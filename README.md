## 🧭 About Me

I am a biologist specialized in wildlife conservation, with a strong focus on spatial ecology, biogeography, and habitat connectivity. Currently, I am pursuing a PhD in Modeling and Experimentation in Science and Technology at the University of Extremadura, where I work on the spatial and ecological dynamics of the invasive Egyptian Goose (*Alopochen aegyptiaca*)

I have experience in:

- 🗺️ Geographic Information Systems (QGIS, ArcGIS & R)
- 🛰️ Remote Sensing
- 🌍 Species Distribution Modeling and landscape connectivity
- 🦇 Biodiversity monitoring in wetlands and solar infrastructures
- 🤖 EU-certified UAV pilot

My goal is to apply geospatial tools and emerging technologies (drones, camera traps, acoustic recorders for birds and bats, and artificial intelligence) to advance biodiversity conservation and environmental research.
