## 🧭 About Me

I am a biologist specialised in wildlife conservation, with a focus on spatial ecology, biogeography, and habitat connectivity. I am currently a PhD student at the University of Extremadura; my doctoral research focuses on the spatial and ecological dynamics of the invasive Egyptian Goose (*Alopochen aegyptiaca*). I work as a Research Scientist in the Conservation Biology Group at the University of Extremadura, where I focus on spatial analysis and wetlands. Also, I work in biodiversity monitoring in solar infrastructures.

My goal is to apply geospatial tools and diverse technologies (UAVs, camera traps, passive acoustic monitoring devices, and AI) to advance biodiversity conservation and environmental research.
